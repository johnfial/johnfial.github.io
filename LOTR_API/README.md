# Welcome to Lord of the Rings Fellowship Quotes!

### This is a quick project I built to display the quotes from the 9 Fellowship members using "The One Ring API" It's  an exercise demonstrating building a web app to interact with an API using Vue.js. 

###### *Unfortunately, the API only includes movie quotes, not all dialogue from the original book. Copyright permissions aside, turning the full dialogue into an API might be a project of mine someday!

- Thanks to: Merritt and both Pete and Austin for the help!
- Thanks to: a href="https://the-one-api.dev/" target="blank"API: The One API.
- Note: Quotes are only from the movies and are displayed in sequential order (this is how the API responds to requests).
