This Wandering Day Lyrics

[Verse 1]
The sun is fast falling beneath trees of stone
The light in the tower no longer my home
Past eyes of pale fire, black sand for my bed
I trade all I’ve known for the unknown ahead

[Chorus 1]
Call to me, call to me lands far away
For I must now wander this wandering day
Away I must wander this wandering day

[Verse 2]
Of drink I have little and food I have less
My strength tells me no, but the path demands yes
My legs are so short and the way is so long
I’ve no rest nor comfort, no comfort but song

[Chorus 2];
Sing to me, sing to me lands far away
Oh rise up and guide me this wandering day
Please promise to find me this wandering day

[verse]
Tales be rewritten, not set in stone
Idols or parents, here or for'gone
Believe in ourselves for we're all that we have     -----------
For 'morrow's our future, and yes we are glad       -----------

[chorus]
welcome me, welcome me, lands near at last
our time may be short but our hands can work fast
oh! hold to our song now, lands with us at last (till you are past)

[verse]
short time i shall settle, and reap fruits i sowed
two seasons or three now, adventure's no goal
our lives demand change whether wanted or no
our knowledge is true gold, of that i sure know

[chorus]
sing to me...

[Verse 3]
At last comes their answer, through cold and through frost
That not all who wonder or wander are lost
No matter the sorrow, no matter the cost
That not all who wonder or wander are lost

-----------

All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep roots are not reached by the frost. From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king. --Tolkien, J.R.R..
